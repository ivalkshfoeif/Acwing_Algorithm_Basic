# Acwing_Algorithm_Basic

## Hello World

I am an algorithm competition enthusiast, this repository will record my algorithm competition and c++ journey

This is a beginner's repository, I'll start with the basics

I try to write understandable code, but if I follow the fast mode of writing algorithm (every variable is as short as possible), I will leave enough comments at the beginning

Current working on basic dynamic programming and graph theory
